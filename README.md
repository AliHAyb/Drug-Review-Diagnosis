# Drug-Review-Diagnosis
Multi Class Text Classification on Drug Reviews

In this project, the goal is to apply Machine Learning to NLP, in order to extract patterns from drug reviews
and then use them to predict the medical condition.
Hence, we can consider the trained model as diagnosis tool.
In order to achieve the objective, several ML frameworks will be used to build and train 
some relevant classifiers that can do the job.


In this Project, the tools used was:
Scikitlearn for preprocessing and traning traditional ML models like RandomForest.
Tensorflow to build a RNN/LSTM model for NLP analysis and classification.
Among other...

The project consists of 3 main parts:
1-EDA and Preprocessing Phase
2-Deep Learning Section
3-Traditional ML section
